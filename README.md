# Getting Started with Create React App

# Personal Finance Management App

## Overview
This project is a personal finance management application built using React.js. It allows users to track their income and expenses, categorize transactions, generate visual reports, and manage budgets for each category. The app uses **json-server** as a fake REST API (with `db.json`) to simulate CRUD operations on financial data.

## Features
- **Track Transactions**: Allows users to add, edit, and delete transactions.
- **Categorization**: Users can categorize transactions under predefined categories such as Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.
- **Visual Reports**: Displays spending patterns using pie charts and bar graphs.
- **Budget Management**: Users can set monthly budget limits for each category and get notifications if they exceed the budget.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js (with Create React App)
- **Backend**: json-server (using `db.json` to simulate API endpoints)
- **Charting Library**: Chart.js for visual reports
- **Database**: `db.json` for in-memory data storage via json-server
